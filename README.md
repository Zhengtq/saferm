# What is saferm?
A safe deletion script to prevent you from wrongly delete important files in your linux system.
# How it works?
Everytime when you delete a file, it actually move the file to a hidden folder named .saferm_xxx_yyy in the same location where you delete. xxx means the timastamp when you delete, yyy is a random number. This hidden folder will keep for serveral days(which is depended on your appointament) before it is trully deleted.
